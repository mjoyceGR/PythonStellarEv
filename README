This package contains the code
	main.py
	functions_bank.py
	constants_bank.py
	plotmodule.py
	rk2d.f90 (default in my code is to run without this- this was a "for fun" exercise that has not been extensively tested and it is not needed solve the problemsfor)

and the data files
	theta_xi.dat
	physical.dat
	physical_solar.dat
	physical_BBN.dat
	physical_M1.3.dat
	wdstats.dat
	fortran_input.txt (fortran input file, status = old; default is to run without this) 
	results.txt (fortran output file, status = old; default is to run without this)

	data files with the extension "joycerun" are the versions I computed with my machine; running the code will generate these files with the names as written here

All scripts must be in the same repository in order to run code correctly
Requires python 2.7 or higher, gfortran compiler if you want to try the rk2d.f90 subroutine (not currently the default; not extensively tested; not necessary)

BEFORE RUNNING, adjust mass, chemical composition, polytropic index, and anything else you want to vary in "constants_bank.py"
See "main.py" for instructions on execution
Dummy data files from a run on my computer are included- change the names in main.py / plotmodule.py if desired

Plotting module "plotmodule.py" may be executed on its own AFTER main.py has generated the appropriate data files, but this is equivalent to setting "plot_everything" to "True" in main.py

The routine main_withfortran.py uses fortran 90 for numerical integration rather than python; it has not been extensively tested. My results and analysis are based on main.py, which uses python for all of the methods.
